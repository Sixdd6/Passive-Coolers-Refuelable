	<description>This mod allows you to refuel passive coolers with wood saving you the tedious task of rebuilding them every few days. A patch is included for vegetable garden bamboo, also works with Extended Woodworking.\n\nThe "fuel" it stores is less than the cost in wood to build so I figure if you have to refuel them more often it offsets the benefit of less micromanagement.
