	<description>This mod allows you to refuel passive coolers with wood saving you the tedious task of rebuilding them every few days. A patch is included for vegetable garden bamboo, also works with Extended Woodworking.\n\nThe "fuel" it stores is equal to the cost in wood to build and lasts the same length so I figure it's balanced enough just with a bit less micromanagement.
